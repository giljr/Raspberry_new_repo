# Project Raspberry Pi - New Episodes

Greetings!

Four years ago, I created a [Raspberry Pi Series](https://github.com/giljr/raspiSerie). Since then, the Raspberry [Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) has worked hard to simplify things even further. Now, I'm excited to kick off a brand-new series about this beloved board. I invite you to revisit my earlier series and see just how much easier things have become today.

Thanks for stopping by!
